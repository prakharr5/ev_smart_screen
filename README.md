# 🚗 Development of a Smart Screen for Electric Vehicles (EV)

## Project Title

**Smart EV Screen: Infotainment, Customised UI, and Digital Twin Visualization**

## 🌟 Overview

This project is dedicated to designing and prototyping a next-generation smart screen system for Electric Vehicles. It integrates core infotainment functionalities (media, navigation) with critical EV sensor data to create a custom, engaging, and predictive user experience. The central innovation is the **Digital Twin Visualization**, which provides real-time performance monitoring and predictive analytics (like range and battery health).

The application is built using Flutter for cross-platform deployment flexibility.

## ✨ Key Features & Deliverables

The prototype directly addresses the project objectives through the following functional modules:

### 1. Custom UI/UX & Infotainment

- **Intuitive Interface:** A clean, modern, and high-contrast dark-mode UI designed for minimal distraction while driving.
- **Core Infotainment:** Integrated modules for Navigation (Map Placeholder), Media playback, and Device Connectivity (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi status).

### 2. Real-Time Sensor Dashboard

- **Live Metrics:** High-fidelity gauges and data tables showing critical EV parameters (Battery SoC, Voltage, Motor RPM, Temperatures).
- **Data Integration Simulation:** Simulated real-time data input, designed to be connected via CAN bus/OBD-II APIs in a production environment.

### 3. Digital Twin Visualization

- **Interactive Model:** A 2D/3D visual model of the EV synced with live sensor data.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Dedicated panel for advanced Range Estimation based on driving style and terrain, and detailed Battery State of Health (SOH) monitoring.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Flutter (for multi-platform UI development)
- **Language:** Dart
- **UI/UX:** Custom design inspired by high-end EV displays.
- **Animation:** `loading_animation_widget` for the startup sequence.
- **Data Handling:** Placeholder for real-time data streams and API integration.
